# IOTO-webapp
An overview of a project I contributed to during a work term at IOTO.

## What is the IOTO Webapp?
IOTO focuses on collecting publicly available North American political data to use for data vizualization/manipulation. IOTO has built an API so that customers can access this data to use themselves.

    <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="path/to/video.webm" type="video/webm">
  </video>

My team built a web application from scratch using our internal API to showoff what IOTO is capable of while also illustrating fun visual analytics and statistics. 

## How did I contribute?
Working in a small team of three students, I was responsible for a multitude of things. I worked on:

-Scraping politcal data for our database and API

-Implementing legistlator/legislation pages

-Implementing homepage/dashboard

-Implementing news blog to display posts from medium.com

-Implementing geolocation feature to display close by legislators

-Implementing webcaching to improve user experience and decrease API requests

-Implementing search feature
