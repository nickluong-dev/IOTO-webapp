# IOTO-webapp
An overview of a project I contributed to during a work term at IOTO.

## What is the IOTO Webapp?
IOTO focuses on collecting publicly available North American political data to use for data vizualization/manipulation. IOTO has built an API so that customers can access this data to use themselves.

My team built a web application from scratch using our internal API to showoff what IOTO is capable of while also illustrating fun visual analytics and statistics.

## How did I contribute?
Working in a small team of three students, I was responsible for a multitude of things. I worked on:

-Scraping politcal data for our database and API

-Implementing legistlator/legislation pages

-Implementing homepage/dashboard

-Implementing news blog to display posts from medium.com

-Implementing geolocation feature to display close by legislators

-Implementing webcaching to improve user experience and decrease API requests

-Implementing search feature

## Things we didn't get to/Could've improved
-Implementing login/registration using AuthO and creating a backend database for tracking user data
-More customizable graphs for more user interaction
-Implementing provincial data (as of now the site uses federal data only)
